Mer set up app and main structure (dragging dropping and setting up the storyboards)


‘''new project
single view app… then name it and make sure lang is swift

delete the viewController.swift not useful
go into view controller scene and under that delete the View Contoller

click on < navigation controller in the tool palette click it and then drag in into our storyboard

nav controller is to root controller for whole app 
***container view controller***
***it made a relationship for us (before we delete)



now we delete the table view controller


and then drag in the Collection View Controller


now make a new relationship (hold down control)


hit control drag to establish new relationship — Root view controller relationship

you can add a title
now set properties  for the collection View under ruler/sizes make cell size 80 and min spacing 0

now lets set an Image View (palm tree) and drag it into the property
change view to aspect fill (under space rocket, mode …)???
 and change the tag for that view (every view has a tag) and make it a 1
???Why do we do this???


there’s nothing in AppDelegate… in swift app you can ignore that


drag in another controller… A standard View Controller
drag from the Collection View Cell to the new View controller — establish a Segue relationship with push(deprecated)


Need to add in a Larger image, so…
drag in another Image View into the new controller
set it to aspect FIT
set tag to 1


ADD an action button to the title of our new Large Image View
add in Bar Button Item
change it’s identifier to Action







NOW let’s add a controller for our large view in a different way… 
got down to plus button bottom left new file

pick iOS surce file… coacoa touch
class FlikrCVC (collection view controller)
subclass of UI colletioViewController


SAME ALMOST now but 

FlikrFullVC and UIViewController
























IN Large Image View go to  the identity inspector in the third one over (in collection view) change  the class to FlikrFullVC ***The name changes now too because of this***






now all we have to do is configure it!
delete memory warnings in CVC
delete number of items
delete register cell class

not gonna create a model, putting it all in the view controller

**************hover over something hold the option button and click on the question mark


the yellow guys on the side are our controllers 
????????datasource and delegate need to be dragged from collection view to flickerCVC
HOLD DOWN CONTROL to do this


???????in the collection view storybaord it needs select the cell, go to attribute identifier and tell it what the identifier needs to be?????????


WHAT WE ADDED

added pics array and went and grabbed our image in
